# ReplicatedSoftmax
Basic untested version of Replicated Softmax:
@inproceedings{hinton2009replicated,
  title={Replicated softmax: an undirected topic model},
  author={Hinton, Geoffrey E and Salakhutdinov, Ruslan R},
  booktitle={Advances in neural information processing systems},
  pages={1607--1614},
  year={2009}
}
based on Theano RBM implementation from deeplearning.net.
To test download the matlab preprocessed dataset from http://qwone.com/~jason/20Newsgroups/
and put it in the appropriate folder (see below).
This implementation is supposed to provide a framework for further work on RSM,
not just the good results right away.
